This guide will help you set up the Greptile API to answer hard questions about your codebase. There are only three steps, setting up **permissions**, **indexing**, and **querying**.

## Permissions

You'll need a Greptile API key and a GitHub personal access token (PAT) to authenticate your requests.

1. **Greptile API key**

Click [here](https://app.greptile.com/api) to get your Greptile key. You will need to log in via GitHub or Microsoft.


2. **GitHub Access Token**

Greptile needs read access to your GitHub repositories, in order to index them. You can provision a GitHub PAT by following [this guide from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token).

Make sure to select the `repo` scope when creating the token, as this is required for Greptile to clone your repositories.

Support for GitLab and Azure DevOps is coming soon!

## Indexing

Before Greptile can search and answer questions about a repository, it must be indexed. This can take 3-5 minutes for small repositories, and over an hour for bigger ones, but you only need to do this once. Each index that Greptile generates is stored in our database.

1. **Submit a repository for indexing**

You can use the `POST /repositories` endpoint to submit a repository indexing job.

See our [API Reference](/api-reference/index) for more details and to send test requests.

2. **Check repository indexing progress**

You can use the `GET /repositories/{repositoryId}` endpoint to check the status of a repository's index. The `repositoryId` should be URL-encoded in the format `remote:branch:owner/repository`.

The JSON response has a `status` field which should be one of the following options:

- `submitted`: the job is in queue.
- `cloning`: the repository is being cloned to ephemeral storage to begin indexing.
- `processing`: indexing is in progress. This is the longest step.
- `completed`: the repository index is ready to be queried!

See our [API Reference](/api-reference/get-repository) for more details and to send test requests.

## Query

Now, you can send natural language queries to Greptile! To do this, use the `POST /query` endpoint. Note that this endpoint is based on the OpenAI Chat format, so the query must be formatted as a `messages` object, which can simply have length 1.

See our [API Reference](/api-reference/query) for more details and to send test requests.
