Greptile's API can be used to build tools to augment every step of your software development lifecycle using AI, from when you create a ticket to when you merge your code and update your docs. 

Here are some examples, sorted by steps in the software development life cycle.

## Planning & Design
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Task Enricher"
    icon="list-check"
    >
    Integrate Greptile with **GitHub Issues**, **Linear**, **Jira**, **Asana** etc. to automatically add codebase context to every new ticket, detailing how to get started with the ticket, what files to look, etc. 
  </Card>

    <Card
      title="Design Doc Reviewer"
      icon="route"
      >
      Integrate Greptile with **Quip** or **Google Docs** so it can provide codebase context-aware comments, catching gaps and recommending things to consider before you start programming.

    Greptile can answer your teams questions about your source code, right in your **Slack**!
    </Card>
    <Card
      title="Intelligent Debugger"
      icon="bug"
    >
  Integrate with your **debugger** to automatically get codebase context-aware tips for where errors might be coming from! 
    </Card>

    <Card
    title="Commit message generator"
    icon="code-commit"
  >
  Integrate Greptile with `git` to auto-generate a comprehensive, codebase context-aware commit message. Future developers will thank you!

## Testing & Integration
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Test Writer"
    icon="vial-circle-check"
    >
    Greptile's API can generate new tests for each push, simply integrate it with GitHub/Gitlab etc. and configure the app to use Greptile to generate tests on every major code change. 
</Card>

  <Card
    title="AI PR Review Bot"
    icon="user-magnifying-glass"
  >
  Integrate Greptile's API with GitHub and get intelligent, codebase context-aware comments on every PR. The added context can vastly speed up the review process, and catch potential issues that human reviewers might not!
  </Card>

<Card
    title="Auto Doc Updater"
    icon="book-sparkles"
  >
  Integrate Greptile with **GitHub**, **Confluence**, or **Notion**, so Greptile can automatically update your docs when new code is pushed. With full codebase context, the docs are informed and relevant!
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Changelog Writer"
    icon="file-plus-minus"
  >
  Integrate Greptile with your docs pipeline to auto-generate changelogs for every version. Simply pass in the diff and commit message, and Greptile will use it's codebase context awareness to write an informative, complete changelog!
  </Card>
