title: Code Review Bot
description: 'Greptile reviews your pull/merge requests with codebase context-aware comments'
---

<Note>Both GitHub & GitLab supported</Note>

Greptile's code review bot does two things: 

1. summarizes the changes in the pull/merge request

2. comments on specific file changes suggests potential issues and unforeseen consequences of the change. 

### Why is it useful?

Greptile's code review bot writes comments that:

- Are context-aware, so can discuss the implications of the changes to the wider codebase.
- Can address potential security or compliance issues produced by the changes. 
- Summarize the changes with codebase context, making it far easier for a human reviewer to contextualize and parse the changes. 
- Reference similar code or abstractions related to the changes that are already in the codebase, to prevent repition. 

This means less time spent reviewing PRs or awaiting review, and more time spent writing code.
