title: GitHub PR Reviewer
description: 'Greptile reviews your pull requests with codebase context-aware comments'
---

Greptile can be configured to trigger a review:
1. For all PRs
2. PRs in certain workspaces, projects, teams, or labels
3. PRs that mention `@greptile` in the body

Greptile summarized the changes in the PR, suggests potential issues and unforeseen consequences of the changes, and where relevant, comments on specific diffs.

### Installation

Click [here](https://app.greptile.com/apps/github) to install the Linear bot. Once you have installed the bot, you can use the same link to configure the bot. 

Configuration includes:
1. Setting up triggers, for example `@mentions`, or certain filters like workspace, project, team, or label.
2. Setting target repositories for the bot to review PRs for. 
3. *Optional*: Providing "special instructions" for the bot to follow, for example, "Include a section on compliance implications of the changes in the PR.".

<Note>
For Greptile to reference repos, they must first be **indexed**, which can be done by submitting them through the frontend [here](https://app.greptile.com/chat). 
</Note>

### Why is it useful?

Greptile's PR Review bot writes comments that:

1. Are context-aware, so can discuss the implications of the changes to the wider codebase.
2. Can address potential security or compliance issues produced by the changes. 
3. Summarize the changes with code-base context, making it far easier for a human reviewer to contextualize and parse the changes. 
4. Reference similar code or abstractions related to the changes that are already in the codebase, to prevent repition.
